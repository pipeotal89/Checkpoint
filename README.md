stash@{0}: WIP on master: 5b0d491 This is the first commit of the main branch

I had a problem, because when you unstash the changes and try to merge the branches together, there's an error that doesn't let me do the merge until I commit the changes I made on the main branch (different error from the merge conflict one), so I had to commit the changes first before trying to merge
