stash@{0}: WIP on master: 5b0d491 This is the first commit of the main branch

PS C:\Users\felotalo1\Documents\Git\Checkpoint> git merge feature-branch
Auto-merging main-code.js
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in main-code.js
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

I had a problem, because when you unstash the changes and try to merge the branches together, there's an error that doesn't let me do the merge until I commit the changes I made on the main branch (different error from the merge conflict one), so I had to commit the changes first before trying to merge
